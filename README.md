The first problem verifies if a number is prime

The second one prints the greatest commun divisor

The third one makes the product of the divisors


The fourth one prints the Fibbonaci number smaller than a number n given
The last one verify if an array has the asspect of a valley. Eg: [4 3 2 1 2 3]
